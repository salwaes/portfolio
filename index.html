    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a moroccan designer inspiring to explore a new field of work in my domain by combining it with coding skills. As a matter of fact, I was always curious about web programming but I was looking for an opportunity to dive in it within my field. I studied architecture for two years before turning to design which I found to be more conceptual and less creatively constraining. Then finally I found a Design and Coding program, which in order to join it, I decided to learn to code so I could have a more tech approach to create innovative design projects.
